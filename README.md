This repo contains a variety of random stuff from my learning journey. Notes, code snippets, selected texts, smaller projects and problem sets, etc. Larger future projects which I think are worthy of their own repositories will receive them, but I don't want to clutter up my profile with a bunch of easy, beginner efforts. Also, tinkering with this repo will help me master Github functionality. And finally, this will give me a place to track my progress... though I may look into creating a website or blog at some point.

My voyage thus far:

I'm currently working my way through a JavaScript-heavy web dev curriculum curated by P1xt. It consists of the YDKJS book series, Harvard CS50, books on advanced JavaScript (JavaScript Allonge, DOM Enlightenment, JavaScript Design Patterns,), another book--Open Data Structures, a course on MEAN, all of the projects for the FCC backend cert as well as the FCC portfolio project, and then a couple more advanced clone projects. This will obviously take a while, though I'm tentatively hoping to finish by the end of 2017--if not before. 

I'm also in a study group for the above curriculum, as part of the Chingu Cohorts.
