This repo contains a variety of random stuff from my learning journey. Notes, code snippets, selected texts, smaller projects and problem sets, etc.

Larger future projects which I think are worthy of their own repositories will receive them, but I don't want to clutter up my profile with a bunch of easy, beginner efforts.

Also, tinkering with this repo will help me master Github functionality.
